🛠️ Built core features in my Library Management System: 

->Seat booking with seat change support 

->Shift add / remove / update 

->Member management (update / delete) 

On the performance side: 

->Used AbortController to cancel stale API calls and avoid race conditions 

->Added caching for frequent queries like seat availability 

->Applied React Query for safe mutations with optimistic updates + rollbacks 

->These improved both reliability and responsiveness of the system. 

-> role-based allocation admin panel ,notification system
